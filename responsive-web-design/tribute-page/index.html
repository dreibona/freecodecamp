        <p>
          Francisco de Assis França (aka Chico Science) was born in the Rio Doce
          neighbourhood of Olinda, Pernambuco, in Brazil's Northeast Region. As
          a little boy he would sell crabs that he caught himself in the city's
          mangrove swamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          He became the lead singer and major creative driving force of the
          groundbreaking Manguebeat band called Chico Science & Nação Zumbi
          (CSNZ). Influenced by such musicians as James Brown, Grandmaster Flash
          and Kurtis Blow, their music cleverly fused rock, funk, and hip hop
          with maracatu and other traditional rhythms of Brazil's Northeast.
          World music critics found his music "original and distinctive of his
          region." Chico had a powerful stage presence that was compared by some
          to that of Jimi Hendrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 1991, Chico Science, along with singer Fred 04 of the band
          Mundo Livre S/A, founded the Manguebeat cultural movement in response
          to dire economic and cultural stagnation in Recife and Olinda. CSNZ
          made their US debut at New York's Central Park Summerstage in 1995,
          opening for Gilberto Gil, with whom he collaborated during the encore.
          While in NY, they also performed additional shows at CBGB's, SOB's and
          at Bryant Park as part of the JVC Jazz Festival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chico Science & Nação Zumbi toured several times in Europe and brought
          massive attention to the new generation of Brazilian artists in the
          1990s. With only two full albums released during his lifetime, 'Da
          Lama Ao Caos' ('From Mud To Chaos) and 'Afrociberdelia', his influence
          and vision became the foundation to a whole new generation of
          musicians in Brazil. At the time of his death, The New York Times said
          he was "widely hailed as the future of Brazilian music." The Governor
          of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco declared three days of mourning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1996, Chico Science contributed Maracatu Atômico along with Nação
          Zumbi to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot
          Organization. Nação Zumbi have continued to record and tour
          internationally after Chico's death.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chico Science died in a car accident on February 2, 1997. He lost
          control of his Fiat Uno and hit a side light post after another car
          cut him off. He was rescued alive but he did not survive his injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was buried on February 3 in Cemitério de Santo Amaro located in
          Recife.
        </p>
        <p>
          10 years after his death, his family was compensated by Fiat due a
          failure in the seatbelt that could save his life.
